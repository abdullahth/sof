Running the script for the first time will create a directory called (Reports).
Reports Directory will have:

- .png files as a plot for each question if it is important

# How to Run the Script

- SECOND: You need to download the database from this link: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey
- THIRD: Copy the main database file '.csv' and paste it into the repository file
- Finally: Open Jupyter Notebook and from cell menu choose 'Run All'

# Not A Developer
In case you're not a developer but you want to see results open app.ipynb online on github and each cell is followed by its results.

A full Report Link will be attached when it is finished to be used as a material (It is open sourced)
